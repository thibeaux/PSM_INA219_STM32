# INA219 library for STM32 (HAL)
## Overview
This code was tested using a Nucleo-F446RE. I suggest copy and pasting the code into a new program that you generated using the CUBEIDE. This update to the library is supposed to add more documentation and functionality. What was trying to be done was creating a library with ready to go files for a battery monitoring system with relevant statstics to be generated using the INA219 current sensor. This project was made in C using the HAL library. I made this fork so I can give the original creaters credit for thier contribution while providing my own additions as well.
